TO DO LIST (because there seems to be too much to get done haha)

-	Add Port option #define macros to MPInterpreter

-	Modify MPInterpreter so that its init process is modularized into sub routines.
	The main goal of this modification is to allow implementation of the method below.
	MPInterpreter will be able to conveniently create and delete its internal Tcl_interp object
	
-	Modify MPMacPorts to have a setOptions:(NSArray *) method of various port options

-	Move Authorizations functionality into a new MPAuthorization(s) class

-	Modify MPNotifications to allow for possible hooks for Bindings

-	Do an alternate GC compatible build?

-	Move major port functionality from MPPort to MPMacPorts?
