 The MPNotifications class aids in handling notifications of port activity that are to be
 sent to Framework clients. The following constants MPMSG, MPINFO, MPWARN, MPERROR, MPDEBUG
 define the names of notifications that Framework clients can register for.
 
 The posted notificaion's userInfo dictionary contains the following keys and values
 MPNOTIFICATION_NAME - The name of the notification e.g. MPWARN, MPDEBUG etc.
 MPCHANNEL - The channel to which the message was logged eg. stdout, stderr
 MPPREFIX - The prefix string for this message e.g. DEBUG:
 MPMETHOD - The method whose execution led to this notification eg. sync, selfupdate
 MPMESSAGE - The output message logged to channel
 
 
 THERE IS A REASON I'M NOT INCLUDING MPALL AS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE NOTIFICATIONS TO REGISTER FOR.
 HOW IS THE FRAMEWORK SUPPOSE TO KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAS REGISTERED FOR ALL NOTIFICATIONS? THE ONLY
 WAY TO DO THAT THAT I CAN SEE IS FORCING CLIENTS TO USE A CUSTOM METHOD (THAT UPDATES SOME
 INTERNAL VARIABLE) OTHER THAN THE COCOA NSNOTIFICATION METHODS FOR REGISTERING ... I DON'T
 WANT TO DO THAT.
 
 SO CLIENTS CAN BOTH REGISTER FOR AND BLOCK CERTAIN NOTIFICATIONS FROM BEING SENT ... IS THIS
 TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY? WILL THIS GET CONFUSING? IF I WAS A FRAMEWORK USER I WOULD JUST
 REGISTER FOR THE NOTIFICATIONS I'M INTERESTED IN AND NOT CARE ABOUT THE REST. BUT ON THE
 FRAMEWORK SIDE I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH OVERHEAD OF SENDING A NOTIFICATION OF THE CLIENT
 IS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO USE IT ....
 
 OK DISCUSS WITH RANDALL.
